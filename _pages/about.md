I am currently a senior quantitative user researcher for one of the largest digital asset exchanges, working on behavioural data analysis in the financial sector. Previously, I was a senior research engineer at [Ultraleap](https://www.ultraleap.com) in Bristol, UK. Prior to joining Ultraleap, I worked at Vodafone Research as a research data scientist with [Dr Nuria Oliver](https://www.nuriaoliver.com). I hold a PhD in human-computer interaction from [Glasgow Caledonian University](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/), where I was a member of the [ITT Group](https://www.ittgroup.org) and advised by [Lynne Baillie](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/lynne-baillie) and [Martin Halvey](https://https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/halveymartindr/).

I specialise in analysing human attitudinal and behavioural data using statistical modelling and machine learning techniques. My research focuses on understanding user interactions, experiences, and adoption patterns across technologies like augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, telecommunications, and cryptocurrencies. My passion lies in developing intelligent and adaptive user interfaces that directly address individual needs through ambient sensing, context comprehension, and understanding user intention to enhance the overall user experience.
