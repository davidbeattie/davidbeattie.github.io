I am a senior research engineer at [Ultraleap](https://www.ultraleap.com) in Bristol, UK. Prior to joining Ultraleap, I worked at Vodafone Research as a research data scientist with [Dr Nuria Oliver](https://www.nuriaoliver.com). I hold a PhD in human-computer interaction from [Glasgow Caledonian University](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/), where I was a member of the [ITT Group](https://www.ittgroup.org) and advised by [Lynne Baillie](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/lynne-baillie) and [Martin Halvey](https://https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/halveymartindr/).

My research interests span human-computer interaction, user experience research, and machine learning. Primarily, I am interested in the design of intelligent and adaptive user interfaces, multimodal feedback, and human perception and behaviour modelling. I consider myself a mixed-methods researcher. I leverage statistical and machine learning techniques, conduct psychophysical experiments, and undertake qualitative user research to capture behavioural insights that inform the design of human-computer interaction technologies.
