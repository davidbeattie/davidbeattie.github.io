>This project investigates novel methods of interaction on mobile devices, from sensation technologies to affective media. The primary aim of this project is to explore completely new and untried ways of interacting with our mobile devices in order to first discover and prototype ways to integrate potentially useful technologies into mobile device interaction, and second to establish whether interaction immersion and user enjoyment is increased.

###### Feeling the next track: designing mobile music player previews

<i class="fa fa-sticky-note" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a href="javascript:showhide('emmi1')">_Abstract_</a>
<div id="emmi1" style="display:none;">
<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> We present a novel method of interaction for users to preview an audio track haptically. The preview enables users to" feel" the track they want to select, thus saving them from having to look at the screen or listen to the track before actually playing it. Our results show that users enjoyed the combination of audio and haptic feedback and that users would very much like to see this type of sensory collaboration being incorporated into their own mobile device.</div> </p>

###### Feel what you hear: haptic feedback as an accompaniment to mobile music playback

<i class="fa fa-sticky-note" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a href="javascript:showhide('emmi2')">_Abstract_</a>
<div id="emmi2" style="display:none;">
<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> The paper describes the creation of a mobile music player accompanied with synchronised haptic feedback to create a novel method of audio playback on a mobile device. There has been extensive research into the development of audio haptic systems to enhance user interaction on mobile devices as well as providing useful information about users' surroundings while way-finding. We investigated an alternative collaboration of haptics and audio feedback which we present here. We believe that this collaboration provides a novel and fun method of interaction with a music playback application.</div> </p>
