NoozClient is an iPhone application offering a podcast service that aggregates data from Facebook, Twitter and RSS feeds using speech synthesis, along with music played back from user iTunes libraries. 

The app was evaluated to establish whether:
* it was sufficiently useful
* the UI was usable
* people enjoyed their social media feeds read out via synthesised speech

Three evaluations were conducted, which were a focus group, a design workshop, and a usability field study.
