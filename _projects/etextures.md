>E-Textures is a project that seeks to commercialise some recent work achieved by our team at Ultraleap. It is essentially a 1 year extension of the EU funded [H-Reality](https://www.hreality.eu) project, but the work will be targetted specifically towards product commercialisation and prototype demonstration.

<div id="etexture" style="display:none;">
<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> The E-Textures project is funded through the FET Innovation Launchpad. It aims to focus on commercializing mid-air haptic texture generation, a novel technology developed within the H-Reality project that would unlock the virtualization and digitization of mid-air touch interactions in the immersive and digital signage advertising markets (e.g., touching holograms of different fabrics in a shop) and enable novel business use-cases in new market verticals spanning from media and entertainment to retail and healthcare. 

Our three project objectives are to: 

(1) understand market opportunities through market research and validation activities

(2) create demo prototypes that address the identified market opportunities and achieve product-market fit

(3) engage with industry and validate a business model that will kickstart commercial activities.</div> </p>
